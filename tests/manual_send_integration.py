If the goal is to get a job, switch companies or role, then focus more on the interview aspect first. Keep into account the, who the user is and their experience level, user's target job roles at target companies with the timeline.\\n\\n3. Create a list of skills and priority in interviews\\n\\n4. Now based on the current skill level, target job roles at desired target companies of the user, decide what skills the user needs to work on more and what skills user can decide to not focus on as much as the user is already good in those. You can also skip the skills if they are alternatives to the skills user already has. e.g. for frontend if the user is skilled in react, then no need to add angular or vue as those are alternatives to react. If there are multiple such alternatives skills consider one of them which is relevant for the target company and skip the rest. e.g. there are different cloud service providers like aws, gcp, azure. User only needs to know one of them, to get started. and only if needed, they need to work on multiple of them.    \\n\\n5. list down the skills like this.\\n{ \\\"required_skills\\\": [\\\"skill1\\\", \\\"skill2\\\", \\\"skill3\\\"],\\n  \\\"skills_to_skip\\\": [\\\"skill4\\\", \\\"skill7\\\", \\\"skill12\\\" ]\\n}\\n6.

Now according to the plan, and the topics in each skill and considering the user current state (current_level), map the topics which are required and which can be skipped\\nNow the goal is to understand what topics for each skill should be added in the roadmap and what can be skipped.\\nA topic can be skipped for two reasons:\\n    1. If the user is already aware of it according the the current level of the user.\\n    2. If the Topic is not required for the user's target goals which is {goal} as {domains} and targetting {companies} companies\\n8. Based on this add to the group in step 6 to contain topics too \\ne.g.\\n# f1\\n## S1\\n- Topic11\\n- Topic12\\n- Topic13\\n- Topic14\\n## S2\\n- Topic21 [Skipped - Familiar]\\n- Topic22\\n- Topic23\\n- Topic24 [Skipped - Not Required]\\n# f2\\n## S3\\n- Topic31\\n- Topic32\\n- Topic33 [Skipped - Not Required]\\n- Topic34 [Skipped - Not Required]\\n## S4\\n- Topic41\\n- Topic42\\n- Topic43\\n- Topic44\\n# f3\\n## S5\\n## S6\\n# f4\\n## S8\\n## S9\\n## S10\\n\\nHere Topics are coming from topics_array.\\nDo's:\\n- If the skill1 is prerequisite of skill2, skill1 should be covered first then go to skill2.\\n- f1 is the not the complete focus area title but just f1\\n- S1 is the not the complete Skill title but just S1\\n- Topics41 is the complete topic title\\n- Skipped can only by of two types: 1.
